Contao Open Source CMS API changes
==================================

Version 3.* to 4.0
------------------

### Protected folders

In Contao 3, the user files in the `files/` directory were publicly available
via HTTP by default and it was possible to protect certain subfolders. Now, due
to a technical change, the user files are protected by default and subfolders
have to be published explicitly to be available via HTTP.
